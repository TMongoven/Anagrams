# Anagrams

Anagrams is a game where the player must create as many words as possible from a specified list of letters within a specified time frame.

In this game, the player will be prompted how many seconds they would like to have to enter words.
Following this, they will be given a collection of letters and will will get the chance to enter in words that they make from that collection.
If their word doesn't exist in the dictionary, or they have made that guess before in this round, they will be given no points.
Otherwise, the point breakout for correct words is as follows:
      - 100 points - 3 letter word
      - 400 points - 4 letter word
      - 1200 points - 5 letter word
      - 2000 points - 6 letter word (there will always be a 6 letter word that can be made from the randomly generated letters)
      
The time is recalculated after each guess, and if the user has run out of time after a guess, the round will end.
The game will print out the list of correct guesses from the user, the user's score, and all the possible words from the given letters.
